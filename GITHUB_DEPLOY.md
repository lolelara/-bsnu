# üöÄ GitHub Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the PHC Leaflet Generator to GitHub Pages.

## üìã Pre-configured Settings

The application comes with pre-configured settings:
- ‚úÖ **Gemini API Key**: Pre-configured
- ‚úÖ **Appwrite Project ID**: Pre-configured  
- ‚úÖ **Appwrite Endpoint**: Pre-configured

You only need to run the setup once to create the database!

## üéØ Step 1: Run Setup (One Time Only)

### Before deploying to GitHub, run the setup locally:

1. **Open `setup-appwrite.html` in your browser**
   - The API Key and Project ID are already filled in
   - Click "Start Automatic Setup"
   - Wait for completion (1-2 minutes)

2. **Copy the Generated IDs**
   - You'll see Database ID and Collection ID
   - Copy these IDs

3. **Update `config-preset.js`**
   - Open `config-preset.js` in a text editor
   - Find lines 9 and 10:
     ```javascript
     databaseId: '', // Add your Database ID here after setup
     collectionId: '' // Add your Collection ID here after setup
     ```
   - Replace with your IDs:
     ```javascript
     databaseId: 'your-database-id-here',
     collectionId: 'your-collection-id-here'
     ```
   - Save the file

## üîí Security Notes

### Important for Public Deployment:

1. **API Keys are Exposed**
   - In this configuration, API keys are in client-side code
   - They can be seen by anyone viewing the page source
   - This is acceptable for educational projects with proper usage limits

2. **For Production Security:**
   - Move API keys to Appwrite Functions (server-side)
   - Implement user authentication
   - Set up rate limiting
   - Monitor API usage

3. **Gemini API Protection:**
   - Set usage quotas in Google Cloud Console
   - Monitor API usage regularly
   - Restrict API key to specific domains

4. **Appwrite Security:**
   - Database permissions are set to "Any" (public)
   - For production, change to "Users" (authenticated only)
   - Implement user roles and permissions

---

## üìä Monitoring Usage

### Google Gemini API:
1. Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Dashboard"
4. Monitor usage and quotas

### Appwrite:
1. Log in to [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io)
2. Select your project
3. View dashboard for usage statistics
4. Monitor database size and API calls
